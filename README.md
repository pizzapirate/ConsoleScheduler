# A Console Scheduler made in C#

This is a simple console scheduler made in C#. Users are able to create a basic schedule similar to Task Scheduler. 

It has been made as a way to automate tasks on a Windows machine every minute on weekdays between certain hours, and Task Scheduler was not working as it would flag the applications as being automated.
